                <h1>Your questions answered</h1>
                <p>I've put together a list of some questions you might have.</p>
                <p>If you can't find the answer here, please don't hesitate to <a href="/contact.html"><strong>contact me</strong></a>.</p>

            <div class="dropdown-container-2 fade-in">
                <h2>General</h2>

                <div class="dropdown fade-in" data-dropdown="1"><div class="dropdown-header"><h3>How does it work?</h3></div>
                <div class="dropdown-content"><div class="dropdown-inner">
                            <p>Firstly, contact me via the <a href="/contact.html"><strong>contact page</strong></a> to begin the initial consultation phase. Tell me as much as you can about what you'd like for your site, and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: the more detail you can give me at this stage, the smoother the process will be. Changes later can cost extra.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>When I have a clear understanding of your needs, I'll send you a contract to sign. Once that contract has been signed, I'll begin work on your website, and I'll keep you updated on the progress. This is when you'd send me any content you want on the website, such as images and text.</p>
                            <p>When the site has been built, I'll send you a link to take a look. At this stage, I'm happy to make non-structural changes, such as colours, effects, images, etc. However, if you'd like me to make any structural changes, such as new pages or changing the page layout, that will incur an additional fee. This is why it's so important to be as detailed as possible during the initial consultation phase, as anything agreed upon during that phase will be included in the ongoing monthly fee.</p>
                            <p>After any changes have been made, the site will go live soon thereafter. If you have a domain you'd like me to connect to the website, I can do that for you too.</p>
                            <p>And... that's it! You'll be able to make unlimited content changes (such as images or text) to the site going forward simply by emailing me. I'll make sure to monitor the site regularly, to ensure everything is running smoothly. If everything goes according to plan, you should never have to worry about your website ever again.</p>
                </div></div></div>

                <div class="dropdown fade-in" data-dropdown="2"><div class="dropdown-header"><h3>And how does the monthly plan work?</h3></div>
                <div class="dropdown-content"><div class="dropdown-inner">
                            <p>You pay a single monthly fee, and that's it! No hidden or extra costs. Unless you decide to add pages or change the structure of the website, the monthly fee is all you'll pay.</p>
                </div></div></div>

                <div class="dropdown fade-in" data-dropdown="3"><div class="dropdown-header"><h3>Is there really no upfront fee?</h3></div>
                <div class="dropdown-content"><div class="dropdown-inner">
                            <p>That's correct! With the exception of some optional add-ons, which are not included in the standard packages, there is no upfront fee. Once you sign the contract, the monthly fee is all you need to pay.</p>
                </div></div></div>

                <div class="dropdown fade-in" data-dropdown="4"><div class="dropdown-header"><h3>Do I have to sign a long-term contract?</h3></div>
                <div class="dropdown-content"><div class="dropdown-inner">
                            <p>No. All contracts are month-to-month. When you pay, you're paying for the following month, so if you decide to stop at any point, you can without any cancellation penalties. All I ask is that you give me thirty days notice before you intend to cancel.</p>
                            <p>Please note that if you cancel <strong>without</strong> giving notice and decide to re-activate your website again in the future, you will be required to pay for the months between your initial cancellation and your request for re-activation before the site will be re-activated.</p>                
                        </div></div></div>

                <div class="dropdown fade-in" data-dropdown="5"><div class="dropdown-header"><h3>What happens if I cancel?</h3></div>
                <div class="dropdown-content"><div class="dropdown-inner">
                            <p>The website will remain online until the end of your billing period, at which point it'll be taken offline.</p>
                </div></div></div>

                <div class="dropdown fade-in" data-dropdown="6"><div class="dropdown-header"><h3>Who actually owns the website?</h3></div>
                <div class="dropdown-content"><div class="dropdown-inner">
                            <p>Unless you decide to pay the Fixed Buyout Fee, which will be specified in your contract, I retain ownership of the site. However, the ownership of the domain name, as well as any images or content you provide to me will, of course, remain yours.</p>
                </div></div></div>

                <div class="dropdown fade-in" data-dropdown="7"><div class="dropdown-header"><h3>Can I buy the website outright later?</h3></div>
                <div class="dropdown-content"><div class="dropdown-inner">
                            <p>Absolutely! In your contract, there will be a Fixed Buyout Fee specified. If you decide to pay that fee at any time, you will become the sole owner of the entire website. If you decide to pay that fee and want me to continue to host and manage your site, I can do that too. But that would be up to you!</p>
                </div></div></div>

                <h2>Pricing & Billing</h2>

                <div class="dropdown fade-in" data-dropdown="1"><div class="dropdown-header"><h3>When are payments taken each month?</h3></div>
                <div class="dropdown-content"><div class="dropdown-inner">
                            <p>Payments are taken each month on or around the date your first payment was made. So, if you signed up on 23 November, then all subsequent payments will be taken on or around the 23rd of each month going forward.</p>
                </div></div></div>

                <div class="dropdown fade-in" data-dropdown="2"><div class="dropdown-header"><h3>Do prices ever change?</h3></div>
                <div class="dropdown-content"><div class="dropdown-inner">
                            <p>With the exception of the annual price adjustment, which I explain in the following question on this page, your monthly fee will not increase.</p>
                </div></div></div>

                <div class="dropdown fade-in" data-dropdown="3"><div class="dropdown-header"><h3>How does the annual price adjustment work?</h3></div>
                <div class="dropdown-content"><div class="dropdown-inner">
                            <p>Each year in April, I may increase the monthly rate, either by £5, or the UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) plus 3%, whichever is greater. If the CPI method is used, I will use the figure from the preceding December.</p>
                </div></div></div>

                <div class="dropdown fade-in" data-dropdown="4"><div class="dropdown-header"><h3>What happens if my payment fails?</h3></div>
                <div class="dropdown-content"><div class="dropdown-inner">
                            <p>If a payment fails, the payment system will automatically attempt to make the payment three times: two, five, and seven days later. If the payment fails after the third attempt, the site will be taken offline and I will treat it as a cancellation without notice.</p>
                            <p>If you think you're not going to be able to pay, please let me know. The site will still be taken offline, but you won't need to make any extra payments once you're able to pay to have it back online, whereas you would if you didn't notify me.</p>
                </div></div></div>

                <div class="dropdown fade-in" data-dropdown="5"><div class="dropdown-header"><h3>What happens if I stop paying?</h3></div>
                <div class="dropdown-content"><div class="dropdown-inner">
                            <p>Your website will be taken offline.</p>
                            <p>If you give me notice beforehand, then you won't be required to make any payments if you'd like to re-activate the site again in the future.</p>
                            <p>If you stop payment without notifying me and wish to re-activate the site again in the future, then you'll be required to pay for the months the site was offline before the site will be re-activated.</p>
                        </div></div></div>

                <div class="dropdown fade-in" data-dropdown="6"><div class="dropdown-header"><h3>Is VAT included in the price?</h3></div>
                <div class="dropdown-content"><div class="dropdown-inner">
                            <p>At present, I'm not registered for VAT, so VAT is not charged on any of my prices. Should I become VAT-registered in the future, I'll inform all clients in advance, and any changes to pricing will be communicated clearly before taking effect.</p>
                </div></div></div>

                <div class="dropdown fade-in" data-dropdown="7"><div class="dropdown-header"><h3>What is your refund policy?</h3></div>
                <div class="dropdown-content"><div class="dropdown-inner">
                            <p>I provide ongoing website design, hosting, and maintenance services on a subscription basis. Because these services begin immediately and involve continuous time, hosting, and resources, all payments are non-refundable once collected. This also means that the statutory 14-day cooling-off period under the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013 does not apply once the contract has been signed.</p>
                            <p>Of course, if there's ever an issue or you're unhappy with my work, please reach out. I'll always do my best to make it right.</p>

                            <p>Adding extra pages, changing page layouts, or any other change that involves changing the code or underlying architecture of the website. If you're not sure if a change you'd like to make would be considered a larger change, then feel free to contact me and we can discuss it further.</p>

                            <p>This will depend on a number of circumstances, including how complex the project is, how much detail you provide, and how quickly you can provide me the images and content you'd like on the site. However, as a general rule of thumb, most sites take a few weeks to make, test, and deploy.</p>

                            <p>Absolutely! This would be considered a larger change, and would incur a separate cost. But if you want a new design for your site, that is absolutely something I can do for you.</p>

                            <p>Absolutely. Your site will always have an SSL certificate, and the site will be securely stored in multiple locations, ensuring that nothing will ever be lost.</p>

                            <p>You can! If you're comfortable to do it, then you can arrange that at your end. However, I always recommend that the process of sorting out the domain be something that I manage solely from my end, as it's usually simpler. If you're comfortable allowing me to manage your domain, then I'll be happy to do so.</p>

                            <p>In short: content changes. That includes text and images. Making changes to either of these is genuinely unlimited.</p>
                </div></div></div>

                <div class="dropdown fade-in" data-dropdown="2"><div class="dropdown-header"><h3>How quickly do you make changes after I request them?</h3></div>
                <div class="dropdown-content"><div class="dropdown-inner">
                            <p>As soon as I can! I never like to make promises as to how quickly I can make and deploy new changes, but content change requests are always my main priority, and I will let you know when the change has been made.</p>
                </div></div></div>

                <div class="dropdown fade-in" data-dropdown="3"><div class="dropdown-header"><h3>What happens if my site goes offline?</h3></div>

                            <p>If the site went offline due to non-payment, then it simply remains offline until the situation has been resolved.</p>
                            <p>However, if the site has gone offline unexpectedly, then you can be assured that I will do everything to ensure that service is restored as soon as possible. However, this is extremely unlikely to happen. Netlify, the service I use to host all of my client's websites, is extremely reliable, with an almost 100% guaranteed uptime.</p>

                            <p>Absolutely, in multiple locations. While I never make promises, the likelihood of losing your website data is as close to zero as it can possibly be.</p>
